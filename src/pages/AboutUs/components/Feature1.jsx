              The first Caritas missionaries arrived in the Philippines in 1992,
              fulfilling their founderâ€™s dream of expanding the mission to the
              country. In 1994, Caritas Don Bosco School was established near
              Laguna Technopark to serve the growing community.
            </h2>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-thin leading-10">
              The school started with 21 preschoolers, four Caritas sisters, and
              two lay teachers, all housed at the Santa Rosa Village
              Multi-Purpose Hall. Despite limited facilities, it flourished
              thanks to the support of parents and the local community,
              fostering a true family spirit. Enrollment steadily increased,
              reaching over 1,200 students by 2000.
            </h2>
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-thin leading-10">
              Today, the school upholds its motto "I Love, Therefore I Serve,"
              focusing on the complete formation of the young in line with the
              spirit of St. Francis de Sales and St. John Bosco.
